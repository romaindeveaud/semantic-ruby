I. Installation
semantic-ruby requires a lot of librairies, which require themselves a lot of librairies or packages. It was very painful to install all these things by yourself, so we created a bash script which install everything you need to run our application. You MUST NOT run the install script with sudo.

  $ sh install.sh

It may be long depending on your internet connection and computer performances. You will be prompted two times, as the red text says, just type 'y' the first time, and 'Enter' without typing anything before the second time.

If you have troubles running the install script, please send us a mail, we will answer as soon as possible.
