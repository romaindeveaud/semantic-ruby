I. Installation
/!\ WARNING :
Before doing anything, you have to active Universe and Multiverse repositories. If you don't, the installation script won't work.
Here is a tutorial : http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/sources.php.

semantic-ruby requires a lot of librairies, which require themselves a lot of librairies or packages. It was very painful to install all these things by yourself, so we created a bash script which install everything you need to run our application. You MUST NOT run the install script with sudo.

  $ sh install.sh
  $ source ~/.bashrc

It may be long depending on your internet connection and computer performances. You will be prompted two times, as the red text says, just type 'y' the first time, and 'Enter' without typing anything before the second time.

If you have troubles running the install script, please send us a mail, we will reply as soon as possible.
