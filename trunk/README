I. Installation
/!\ WARNING :
Before doing anything, you have to active Universe and Multiverse repositories. If you don't, the installation script won't work.
Here is a tutorial : http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/sources.php.

Semantic-ruby requires a lot of librairies, which require themselves a lot of librairies or packages. It is very painful to install all these things by yourself, so we created a bash script which install everything you need to run our application.
In the semantic-ruby main directory, you just have to type this command : 

    $ sudo sh install.sh

It may be long depending on your internet connection and computer performances. If you experience troubles installing semantic-ruby, please send us a mail, we will reply as soon as possible.
